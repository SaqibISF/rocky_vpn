      question: "Why do I need a VPN?",
      answer:
        "A VPN (Virtual Private Network) helps protect your online privacy by encrypting your internet connection, ensuring that your data is safe from hackers, ISPs, and potential cyber threats. It also allows you to browse the internet anonymously and access content that might be restricted in certain regions.",
    },
